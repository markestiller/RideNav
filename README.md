# Navigating Urban Environments Using Rideshare Services
Our goal is to develop an algorithm that optimizes the path to take from one neighborhood to another neighborhood, depending on whether the user wants to minimize the time, distance, or cost of the rides. We also wanted to see how much information we could extrapolate, i.e. predict the sizes of the neighborhoods in the data.

Our chosen problem of finding the best path to take to go from a starting neighborhood to an ending neighborhood
is important for several reasons. Firstly, it can help in improving the efficiency of urban transportation, reducing
traffic congestion, and minimizing the time and cost of travel. Secondly, it can aid in identifying areas of the city
that are poorly connected or under-served by transportation, allowing for better planning and resource allocation.
Finally, our chosen problem is a challenging and interesting one, which requires the use of advanced algorithms and
techniques from the field of graph theory and optimization.

We chose our goal because we believe that it has the potential to make a significant impact on the lives of people
living in urban areas, especially in large and densely populated cities. Additionally, we were drawn to the technical
and intellectual challenge that this problem presents, and we believe that by working on this project, we will be able
to develop our skills and knowledge in several areas, including data analysis, algorithm design, and optimization.

# Data Set
For our project, we used ”My Uber Drives” from user Zeeshan-Ul-Hassan Usmani. The data encompassed his
Uber drives in 2016 (1,175 drives total), and it was presented as a csv with the following columns going from left to
right: start date, end date, category, start, stop, number of miles, and purpose. ”Start” and ”stop” referred to the
pickup and drop-off neighborhoods for the Uber ride. ”category” referred to the category of the trip, for example,
business, personal, etc., and ”purpose” referred to the purpose of the trip, for example, meals, errands, etc.

# Computational Overview
As per our goal, we wanted to see if we could optimize for certain key factors of an Uber ride from one destination
to another, such as time, distance, and cost.

To start, we needed to represent our data as a graph. Graphs play a central role in our project because the states
that the Uber ride data encompasses are inherently graphs - each neighborhood connects to another, and we have the
distance and time it took for each ride to connect them. Thus, we represented each unique neighborhood as a node in
the graph, and represented the aggregate of rides between two neighborhoods as a weighted link by looking at factors
such as the time, distance, and cost between the start and stop neighborhoods. We created the graph from our
data set, and we did so through the following process: we passed the data set into read csv, passed that result into
get avg times and miles, passed the result from get avg times and miles into get avg costs. We then combine those
2 dictionaries using combine dict times miles cost, and finally passed the resulting dict into our create graph function.
To get accurate and necessary data for our project, we filtered out the ”category” and ”purpose” columns from
our data set, and this can be clearly seen in the read csv function. We also noticed that some pickup and drop-off locations were unknown, so we filtered those out too.

Since there may be multiple trips with the same endpoints, we computed the average time, average cost, and
average distance for the trip, and stored them in their respective links so that every link in our graph that connects
2 neighborhoods is weighted by these averages.

Next, we wanted to optimize paths between 2 neighborhoods. We used Dijkstra’s algorithm, which was one of
the harder algorithms that we implemented. Dijkstra’s algorithm is a popular algorithm in computer science used
to solve the shortest path problem in a graph. The goal of the algorithm is to find the shortest path from a starting
node to all other nodes in the graph.

The algorithm works by maintaining a set of unvisited nodes, a set of visited nodes, and a set of tentative dis-
tances to each node. Initially, all nodes are unvisited and the distance to each node is set to infinity, except for the
starting node, which has a distance of 0.

At each step of the algorithm, the node with the smallest tentative distance is selected and marked as visited.
Then, for each of its unvisited neighbors, the algorithm calculates a tentative distance by adding the length of the
edge connecting the current node and its neighbor to the current node’s path length so far. If this tentative distance
is less than the current recorded distance to the neighbor, the neighbor’s tentative distance is updated.

The algorithm repeats this process until all nodes have been visited, and the tentative distances for all nodes
have been calculated. The resulting set of tentative distances is the shortest path from the starting node to all other
nodes in the graph. Dijkstra’s algorithm can be applied to minimize other attributes as well, and in our case, our
find best path dijsktras method can additionally minimize path based on cost or time.

We also created the 3 functions below: run find best path for time, run find best path for distance, and
run find best path for cost. These 3 functions are similar to Dijkstra in function (i.e. finds the shortest path),
but we implemented it anyway because we wanted to try multiple coding approaches to solve the same problem.
Doing so allowed us to compare the functions as well as help us in case we ran into problems implementing the
functionality we wanted using an approach.

Additionally, we wondered if we could extrapolate any conclusions about the sizes of the neighborhoods from our
ride data (i.e. predict the sizes of neighborhoods). We implemented the estimate neighborhood size method and
assigned each neighborhood’s size to their respective size attributes.

In order to visualize our results, we used the networkx and matplotlib libraries. We did this by first con-
verting our graph to a networkx graph in the convert to nx() function. This creates networkx nodes ({networkx
obj}.add node) of the neighborhood names and assigns them a size attribute based on 50 times the natural logarithm
of respective size attributes + 1. The 50 scales the nodes to make sure that they are visible, and the log keeps large
neighborhoods from completely covering the screen. If a path is passed in, we convert it to a list of sets of endpoints,
and then use {networkx obj}.add edge to add the edge with a color attribute of red and a weight attribute of the
corresponding link’s cost. If not, we render all edges as black with the respective link costs attached. Then, by using
networkx’s spring layout and draw function, we found the positions of each node and plotted them. To visualize
the graph more clearly, we changed the parameters in the draw functions to customize node sizes, node colors, font
sizes, font colors, and edge widths. Finally, we display the resulting networkx graph using matplotlib.pyplot’s show()
method.

# Instructions for Running the Project
1. Download all files.
2. Install all required libraries in requirements.txt
3. Install the required data set zip file, extract all, and create a folder called ’data’ to store it in.
4. Make sure that the ’data’ folder is at the same depth as the other python files downloaded from the repository.
5. Run main.py

Features: ALL NEIGHBORHOODS is a global function in main.py that contains a set of all of the neighborhood
names in our chosen dataset. These neighborhood names will be useful for running many of the functions in the
main.py file such as run find best path for time, run find best path for distance, and
run find best path for cost.

All the names in ALL NEIGHBORHOODS can be used in the functions in main.py when appropriate. The most
important function in main.py is runner, because it is an interactive function that allows the TA to run whatever
function they want with whatever inputs they want.

The file is interactive, and the user will be asked to fill in the prompts. The file being interactive allows the user
to have greater control over what functions they run and the parameters they pass into the function.

- Start by answering the prompts.
- Click the magnifying glass on the bottom left to zoom in.
- The user could select the area of the network to analyze by clicking and dragging across the screen.
- Analyzing the behavior of this network, notice that some of the links are highlighted in
red. This represents the optimized path.
- Once the display is closed, the user will be prompted and asked whether or not they want to continue performing
calculations.
- At the bottom of our main.py file, we also left a few print statements with neighborhood size estimates and their
actual sizes commented out.


# Discussion

Going back to our research question, we can see that the functions run find best path for time,
run find best path for distance, and run find best path for cost can help optimize the path we should take if
we want to minimize the quantities mentioned in the function header. This is useful for customers that use ride-share
apps such as Uber, because it may allow them to save money and time, depending on what their needs are for any
particular travel. These algorithms may be especially useful for someone who is trying to save money or trying to
make it to an important meeting on time. These may also be very useful for vacation planning, as people who are
on vacation may want to see as many sights as possible, which may be spread out over a large distance. People who
are on vacation may also have a budget they want to stay under and may want to save money, and they may also
have limited time at their vacation destination, so they may also want to use their time efficiently to make the most
of the time they have. In these situations, it is clear how the aforementioned functions above could be of great help.
Some limitations we encountered while trying to display the graph was networkx’s implementation for spring layout.
According to its documentation, spring layout ”Position[s] nodes using Fruchterman-Reingold force-directed algorithm.” In other words, it ”[treats] edges as springs holding nodes close, while treating nodes as repelling objects.”
When we used this function, networkx would output a valid graph. However, many of the nodes were overlapping,
and the text we used to name the nodes would overlap and block each other out.

After changing spring layout and draw’s parameters, we were able to customize the colors and font sizes, which
would help create a more aesthetically pleasing graph.

Another limitation we found was when trying display the neighborhood size; to fix this we changed the size of
the neighborhood in the display by using the functions we made to estimate neighborhood size. Furthermore, since
the visualization is interactive, and one can zoom in and out of the graph to see certain features more clearly, which
helped to negate many of the problems mentioned earlier.

As for further exploration, we considered implementing a function that would plot the coordinates of the neighborhoods, allowing us to map out the structure of a region’s neighborhoods based on just a dataset of Uber rides in the
area. One library that would help with this calculation would be the scikit library, and the MDS (Multi-Dimensional
Scaling), which would find the coordinates of the nodes based on the distances between one nod and all other nodes.
However, figuring out the structure of the neighborhoods using only the Uber data in the dataset was much harder
than anticipated, partially because we did not have enough data, and we ended up scrapping the idea because we
would have needed much more time in order to complete it. However, there is definitely room for further exploration,
and we may come back to this idea in the future for our own personal exploration.

One other fix we could have done would be to add a function that easily finds the selected neighborhoods. In
our current implementation, after displaying the graph, it is quite difficult to locate the neighborhoods we’ve chosen,
especially if its size was smaller than the others. Even though the graph is interactive and allows the user to zoom
in, it is difficult to see where exactly the neighborhoods we chose are.

In our estimation of neighborhood sizes, our estimate for ’Midtown’ is 2.544 while the actual size is 2.254 mi²
according to Wikipedia. This is a 12.0884% difference, which is pretty accurate considering our computation strategy
of taking the averages of all of the links. Other neighborhoods that had less links, however, were very inaccurate.
However, despite the issues and setbacks discussed above, we were able to complete the project in a timely manner
and achieve most of our initial objectives, and we believe as a group that the project went fairly well. We think that
although there is room for improvement and future further exploration, the project was a success
