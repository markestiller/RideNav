# Navigating Urban Environments Using Rideshare Services
Our goal is to develop an algorithm that optimizes the path to take from one neighborhood to another neighborhood, depending on whether the user wants to minimize the time, distance, or cost of the rides. We also wanted to see how much information we could extrapolate, i.e. predict the sizes of the neighborhoods in the data.
